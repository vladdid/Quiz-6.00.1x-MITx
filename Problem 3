Problem 3-1: 

Examine the following code snippet:

  stuff  = _____
  for thing in stuff:
        if thing == 'iPad':
           print "Found it"
Select all the values of the variable "stuff" that will make the code print "Found it".

--> ["iBoy", "iGirl", "iQ", "iC","iPaid","iPad"]

--> ("iBoy", "iGirl", "iQ", "iC","iPaid","iPad")

Problem 3-2:

The following Python code is supposed to compute the square of an integer by using succesive additions.

def Square(x):
    return SquareHelper(abs(x), abs(x))

def SquareHelper(n, x):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    return SquareHelper(n-1, x) + x
What is the wrong with this implentation of procedure Square? Check all that apply.

--> Nothing is wrong; the code is fine as-is.
