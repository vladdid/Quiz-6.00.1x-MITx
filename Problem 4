PROBLEM 4  (10.0/10.0 points):
Write a simple procedure, myLog(x, b), that computes the logarithm of a number x relative to a base b. For example, if x = 16 and b = 2, then the result is 4 - because 24=16. If x = 15 and b = 3, then the result is 2 - because 32 is the largest power of 3 less than 15.

In other words, myLog should return the largest power of b such that b to that power is still less than or equal to x.

x and b are both positive integers; b is an integer greater than or equal to 2. Your function should return an integer answer.

Do not use Python's log functions; instead, please use an iterative or recursive solution to this problem that uses simple arithmatic operators and conditional testing.

Note: Part of what we are testing on this exam is your ability to write comprehensive test suites for your own functions. Thus, we are only providing the specification for the problem and we will not be showing you test case outputs. You will be able to check your code in the following box for syntax errors; once your code runs without syntax errors on our server, your grade will be recorded. So be sure to thoroughly test your function before pasting it here. You will only get ten checks to correct syntax errors. Use these judiciously; we regret that we are unable to give you more than 10 checks.

Answer:

def myLog(x, b):
    if x < b:
        return 0
    else:
        return 1 + myLog(x/b, b)
