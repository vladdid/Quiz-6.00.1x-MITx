PROBLEM 7  (10.0/10.0 points)
McDonaldâ€™s sells Chicken McNuggets in packages of 6, 9 or 20 McNuggets. Thus, it is possible, for example, to buy exactly 15 McNuggets (with one package of 6 and a second package of 9), but it is not possible to buy exactly 16 McNuggets, since no non- negative integer combination of 6's, 9's and 20's add up to 16. To determine if it is possible to buy exactly n McNuggets, one has to find non-negative integer values of a, b, and c such that

6a+9b+20c=n
Write a function, called McNuggets that takes one argument, n, and returns True if it is possible to buy a combination of 6, 9 and 20 pack units such that the total number of McNuggets equals n, and otherwise returns False. Hint: use a guess and check approach.

Note: Part of what we are testing on this exam is your ability to write comprehensive test suites for your own functions. Thus, we are only providing the specification for the problem and we will not be showing you test case outputs. You will be able to check your code in the following box for syntax errors; once your code runs without syntax errors on our server, your grade will be recorded. So be sure to thoroughly test your function before pasting it here. You will only get ten checks to correct syntax errors. Use these judiciously; we regret that we are unable to give you more than 10 checks.

Answer:

def McNuggets(n):
    """
    n is an int
 
    Returns True if some integer combination of 6, 9 and 20 equals n
    Otherwise returns False.
    """
    l1 = n/6
    l2 = n/9
    l3 = n/20
    m = 0
    ans = False
    for a in range(0,l1+1):
        for b in range(0,l2+1):
            for c in range(0,l3+1):
                m = 6*a+9*b+20*c
                if (m == n):
                    ans = True
                    break
               
    if(ans == True):
        return True
    else:
        return False
